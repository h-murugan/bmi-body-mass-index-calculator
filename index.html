          <h1>What your BMI result means</h1>
          <p>
            A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is generally considered a healthy weight. 
            Keeping your weight within this range can help reduce your chances 
            of facing health issues later on, like obesity and type 2 diabetes. 
            It’s wonderful to aim for a balanced diet that’s lower in fat and 
            sugar while adding in lots of delicious fruits and veggies. 
            And let’s not forget the importance of staying active! 
            Try to find time for about 30 minutes of physical activity 
            most days of the week to keep your body happy and healthy.

          <h1>Limitations of BMI</h1>
          <p>
            While BMI is a useful tool for assessing healthy weight, it's important to remember that it doesn't apply perfectly to everyone. Some groups may want to take a closer look at what their BMI results really mean, and in some cases, it might not be the best measure to rely on.

              <h3>Gender</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              When it comes to kids, it's important to remember that their body composition changes as they grow, so we need to consider their age and gender when looking at their BMI.  
            </p>

              <h3>Age</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              As we age, it's common to see increases in body fat and some loss of muscle, which means that BMI might not give a true picture of body fat levels for older adults. 
            </p>
          </div>

              <h3>Muscle</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              Since BMI doesn’t distinguish between muscle and fat, it can sometimes mistakenly label fit individuals as overweight or obese.

              <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              For expectant mothers, weight gain is completely normal as their baby grows. Keeping a healthy BMI before pregnancy is wise and helps reduce potential health risks for both mom and baby.  
            </p>

            <p>
              It's also worth noting that certain health issues may affect some individuals of Black and Asian backgrounds at lower BMI levels than others. If you have questions or concerns, it's always a good idea to chat with your GP or practice nurse for guidance.
